# Magic methods in Cybersecurity

- An object-oriented Python project to demonstrate the use of magic methods in both Python development and potential applications in Cybersecurity

## What this project cover

- a simple `Book` class to show how magic methods work
- use of comparison magic methods to return boolean values in OOP
- shows how these techniques can be used in cybeseccurity for tasks such as log handling, event comparisons and custom alert objects.

## Why magic methods?

dunder methods make python classes behave moe like built-in types. This allows you to:

-customize string representstions of your objects
-enable comparison logic
make your objects iterable, countable and more

## To run:

```bash
python magic_methods_practize.py

## Next steps

More files will demonstrate how magiical methods can be applied in Cybersecurity, for example:
-custom log parsing
-alert object comparison
streamlining forensic analysis tools
